I was exploring the use of Ethereum's solidity to craft out smart contracts and, while looking around, came across this article which guides us through on how to we can go about building our very first dapp: <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorial">Truffle Suite Tutorial</a>

Before trying it out, please ensure that you have the following loaded and ready:

## Development Environment:
1) Node.js v8+ LTS and npm
2) Git
3) <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache">Ganache</a> - a personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests
4) <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> - a cryptocurrency wallet we use to allow our dapp to interact in our browser
